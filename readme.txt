---Tools Used to Create Project---
This project consists of an ER diagram created using Lucidchart, ERdiagram.pdf.

Train.csv, Train_status.csv, Passenger.csv, and Booked.csv, are formatted versions of the provided data set, RSS.zip.

createtable.sql is a script that contains all the CREATE TABLE statements and imports them all. It uses sqlite3.


---Running This Project---
To run this project, run sqlite3 in this directory and run '.read createtable.sql'
to create the tables and import the data from the .csv files.


Once you have done that, we have included all the queries in the file 'queries.txt'.
We copy and pasted each query from queries.txt into the sql session to complete #2-9.
